# Simulated Fragile Object (Virtual Egg)

## Project Description:

The Virtual Eggs Test (Clemente et al.,2015) was adapted from the Box and Blocks Test in order to evaluate the dexterity of sensory enabled prostheses. For their initial studies, origami boxes and spaghetti strands were used as their simulated fragile object (egg). This method of construction while informative, simple and cost effective has limitations for use outside of laboratory settings. For example, it would be potentially challenging for an individual with upper limb loss to construct or reset the aparatus without the presence of another individual which could impact engagement in 'in-the-wild' test scenarios.

In order to address this, this repo contains the [.stl](Assembly stls) and [technical drawings](Technical Drawings) for a passive and reusable egg design. The design can be altered to provide various levels of fragility, and can easily be reset and re-used with a single hand while requiring little to no manual dexterity.

The following section details the construction of the egg.
